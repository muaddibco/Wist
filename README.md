# Wist
>Faber est suae quisque fortunae - Each man is the maker of his own fortune

(Guy Sallust Crisp)


Wist is an experimental platform with new blockchain architecture build from scratch and sharpened for unlimited scaling 
without sacrificing decentralization and with balanced incentivising of functional network participants.

# Core Principles
1. Every account has it's own independent private blockchain that can operate with one type of data. 
2. Consensus is not achieved on meaning of transaction but only on fact that transaction occurred
   -  The only thing that matters is the uniqueness of history
   -  Every receiver is responsible to ascertain that means being accepted are correct and valid
3. Hash and Height of every transaction and Public Key of issuer gets stored in dedicated global blockchain where 
Public Key of issuer and transaction's Height have to be unique. This global blockchain serves for documenting uniqueness 
of history and is the only source of truth for identifying what transaction were passed over network for all network participants.
4. There is mechanism of synchronization that is running on its own global blockchain and every message passed over network 
must have reference to the latest synchronization block otherwise it will be rejected.
5. Any private blockchain is stored only on part of network nodes rather than on all of them. 
All other nodes are storing only one's latest state, documented in the blockchain of history uniqueness.
